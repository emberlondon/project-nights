# Ember London - Project Nights

**Bring Your Own Project**

Project nights are monthly events that take place one-week after the meetup.

They are all about jumping in, getting help and giving back. Be that working on
an upstream change to Ember itself or a side project using Ember. The sessions
are informal, friendly and agenda-less.

Mix with your fellow Embereños and get hacking!

As with all Ember London events, we expect participants to observe our
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/emberlondon/code-of-conduct).

## The Project Night Roster

Starting in 2016, we’re creating a roster of companies who have kindly offered
to host our project nights. Month-to-month we’ll rotate between these great
venues.

- [AlphaSights](https://www.alphasights.com)
- [Show My Homework](https://www.showmyhomework.co.uk)
- [ThoughtBot](https://thoughtbot.com)
- [Trouva](https://www.trouva.com)
- [With Associates](http://withassociates.com)
- [Zapnito](https://www.zapnito.com)

We hope the roster system will showcase the incredible teams using Ember.js in
London, and the amazing products they’re building.

If your organisation would like to join the roster, please submit a pull
request or email [roster@emberlondon.com](mailto:roster@emberlondon.com).
